For this assignment, I wanted to try to create a snapchat filter for my face.
I initially picked the face tracking example because I thought this would be the most 
realistic example to play around with, since face coordinates were already available.

I ended up being on the correct track, but I couldn't necessarily do the fancy
Snapchat filters within the confines of the facetracking example. I used the coordinates
of various facial features to hold objects to create floating pieces, and therefore, a funny 
face. However, getting the google-y eyes and mouth in the correct proportions
was tricky. Still, I wish they could scae as the face moves closer to the camera,
but that is too advanced.

I used a cetntering mechanism to keep the image around the center dot. I also tried to
add a hat, and added a lot of space under the image, but my computer doesn't
let me run the exampe with the eyes and mouth. It works alone, though. Perhaps, it
would work with a computer with more RAM.
